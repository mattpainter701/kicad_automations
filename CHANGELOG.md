### Sprint 1 — Robust KiCad Import Pipeline

### Added
- Stub ComponentDefs for unresolved components — never silently drop parts
- `_make_stub_component()` creates visible "UNRESOLVED" placeholders in schematics
- `_apply_power_map()` remaps KiCad power pin names to project rail names (VCC→VDD_3P3, etc.)
- `_apply_net_prefix()` prevents net collisions by prefixing generic signal names with ref (Q1_G, Q1_S)
- Optional `power_map` dict in YAML spec for explicit power pin remapping
- "Miscellaneous / Discrete" sheet category for unknown/protection/discrete/analog components
- Passive inference from bare YAML entries: `{value: "10k", ref: "R1"}` resolves without `ic:` field
- Expanded section category map: analog, discrete, motor, protection, audio, display, misc
- 26 new tests in `test_import_pipeline.py`

### Changed
- `auto_generate_bypass_caps()` now bypasses 6-pin minimum for power ICs and U-prefixed parts
- Default allocator fallback changed from "mcu" to "misc" — unclassified parts get their own sheet
- `_validate_component_resolution()` detects stub components and emits structural errors
- `_SECTION_CATEGORY_MAP` expanded with common analog/discrete/motor/protection sections

### Fixed
- Voltage regulators (3 pins) now get auto-decoupling caps (was blocked by pin count threshold)
- Two BSS138 FETs in the same design no longer short their gates via shared "G" net
- Components not in registry or KiCad library now produce visible stubs instead of vanishing

### Tests
- 58 total tests (32 presentation + 26 import pipeline), all passing

## [0.1.0] - 2026-04-02

### Initial Release

### Added
- Circuit Weaver schematic generation engine
- 6 subcircuit templates: buck, ldo, clock, ethernet, usb_controller, usb_hub
- 22-component built-in registry with full pin/bypass/strap metadata
- KiCad 8/9/10 symbol library import (10,000+ parts via local install or GitLab)
- Multi-sheet hierarchical schematic generation with boundary net promotion
- Auto-placement engine with topology-aware motif renderers
- Transactional MVP workflow: validate, generate, apply-patch, diff, ingest-pcb-feedback
- PCB placement export and constraint feedback loop
- 3 sample circuits: usb_regulated_supply, led_power_indicator, iot_sensor_node
- Presentation parity: topology-local rendering for all support passives
- Review presentation profile (--presentation-profile review)
- Decoupling bank and strap ladder motif renderers
- 32 tests (bootstrap, helpers, presentation regression)
