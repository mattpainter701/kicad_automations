# Changelog

## [Unreleased]

### Sprint 54 — layout quality zero-crossing gate, density strategy, sheet splitting, autorouter hardening

- (T236) Drive the remaining wire-through-body crossings on the quality-gated samples to **zero** (13 -> 0):
  - Make net-marker stub emission body-aware: label and power-symbol stubs now pick a length whose endpoint *and* marker glyph clear every neighboring symbol body (`_clear_stub_length`), instead of only avoiding the owning symbol's own geometry. This was the dominant crossing class — power symbols and labels parked inside adjacent capacitor bodies.
  - Teach the final wire-hygiene pass to handle T-joint-carrying segments: tapped rails are split at each tap point (taps become piece endpoints, preserving every junction) and each piece is detoured around bodies independently, instead of skipping the segment wholesale.
  - Stop grid-snapping collision keep-out boxes: `component_body_bounds` and the sheet-wide body-box set no longer round corners to the 1.27mm wire grid, which could shrink a box past a wire running just inside its true edge and hide the collision from every detour pass.
  - Lower the `tests/test_layout_quality.py` ceilings to zero for all three gated samples.
- (T237 / audit F13) Replace the connector-heavy boolean cliff in `placer.py` with a continuous density score: `_connector_dominance` computes the fraction of estimated block area contributed by connectors, so a 7-connector board or an 8-connector board with one small regulator now packs width-first, while a few headers around one large MCU keep the normal layout.
- (T238 / audit F15) Stop emitting crammed A0 pages: a sheet that overflows every paper size up to A0 is now split into two area-balanced half-sheets (`split_sheet_allocation`) and re-laid-out; a sheet that cannot be split further raises a clear "Design too large" generation error instead of shipping an unreadable page.
- (T239) Promote the geometric layout-quality analysis from the test suite into `circuit_weaver.layout_quality`: the generator analyzes every emitted sheet, logs warnings for overlaps / wire-body crossings on real designs, and the design report gains a per-sheet "Layout Quality" section. `tests/test_layout_quality.py` now consumes the shared module.
- (T240) Harden the Freerouting autorouter integration:
  - Preflight every board before routing (`preflight_pcb`): the engine's own `*_placement.kicad_pcb` preview (zero pads by design), pad-less boards, and boards without named nets fail closed with a forward-annotation remediation message.
  - Use the supported Specctra pipeline when `kicad-cli` is available: DSN export -> Freerouting `-de/-do` -> `.ses` session with a KiCad import hint; fall back to direct `.kicad_pcb` invocation otherwise.
  - Add `--effort fast|medium|high` (Freerouting `-mp` pass budget) and `--timeout` CLI options, and surface incomplete-route counts in results.
- Full suite: 1107 passed, 1 skipped.

### Sprint 53 — schematic layout quality (congestion, overlaps, readability)

- Stop support passives from stacking at identical coordinates: the sidecar cluster pass now groups by resolved parent-pin location and walks collision-free slots against a sheet-wide occupancy list seeded with cluster poses and junction anchors. Symbol-body overlaps across the nine-sample corpus: 11 → 0.
- Fix passive face detection to trust the pin's angle (top-face pins near a body corner were classified "left", parking buck support parts on the wrong face), and make the buck cluster face-aware so CIN, the SW/FB junction anchors, COUT, and the feedback divider grow away from the pin's actual face instead of hanging below the IC and wiring straight through it.
- Route local passive connections around *all* nearby symbol bodies: `_route_local_connection` now takes sibling-passive/own-body/neighbor-IC keep-out boxes, generates detours around every blocker, and logs a warning when it must relax clearance instead of silently emitting a direct line through symbols (audit F6).
- Cap "local" wiring at 50.8mm of Manhattan run — anchors and owner pins farther away fall back to net labels, eliminating the 60–130mm cross-sheet wires that made sheets unreadable.
- Add a final wire-hygiene pass that rewrites any remaining emitted segment crossing a symbol body as an endpoint-preserving detour (T-joint-carrying segments are left alone). Wire-through-body segments across the corpus: 147 → 36; remaining cases are catalogued in TASKS.md as bank/ladder occupancy follow-ups.
- Add `tests/test_layout_quality.py` — geometric analysis of generated `.kicad_sch` output gating zero symbol overlaps and per-sample wire-crossing ceilings, plus unit regressions for the sidecar, face-detection, routing, budget, and hygiene fixes.
- Make decoupling-bank, strap-ladder, and LDO topology motifs occupancy-aware: each motif now walks a collision-free origin for its passive bodies and local anchors, then reserves those positions before later motifs or sidecars are placed. The shared occupancy pass now deduplicates reservations and immediately seeds anchors created by earlier topology parents before placing later motifs. This closes the first layout follow-up from the Sprint 53 audit and leaves only the post-occupancy endpoint/tapped-rail reductions open in `TASKS.md`.

### Sprint 52 completion — critical and high-priority generation fixes

- Fix the T229 `orphan-net` placement-readiness gate to recognize support-passive endpoints (straps, bypass/bootstrap caps, inductors, feedback dividers) as real second consumers. Regulator SW/FB/BST nodes, ESP32 EN/IO0 strap nets, charger PROG/CELL/QSTRT programming nets, and display IREF/charge-pump nets no longer raise false-positive errors — this restores the sample and corpus release gates from 24 failing tests to green.
- (T228) Complete the removal of `build_generic`'s per-instance signal-net synthesis: unresolved non-power signal pins are never given `{PIN}_{REF}` phantom nets. Pins route through normalized declared interfaces and shared-bus metadata, pin-name role inference fills undeclared roles (so imported parts with pins named `USB_DP` / `SDA` / `XTAL1` land on the shared buses), NC-named pins become explicit no-connects, metadata-declared optional/debug pins stay safely unrouted, and everything else fails generation closed with the pin name and component reference.
- (T228) Stop defaulting SPI chip-select to a per-instance `CS_{REF}` net in `build_generic` — the mapped default made the pin look handled and blocked the SPI chip-select repair pass. CS now maps only when the caller names the net.
- (T233) Add UART flow-control repair: metadata-declared RTS/CTS pins on an actively wired UART complete onto the existing sibling flow-control net when derivable, and otherwise become explicit no-connects instead of floating-input or unmapped-required generation failures. Component repairs now also clear the T228 fail-closed marker for pins they resolve.
- (T234) Propagate the normalized schema to datasheet-derived ingest: `parse_datasheet_text` extracts pin-function tables into normalized `pins`, `pin_roles`, `pin_vdd` / `pin_gnd`, `power_domains`, `explicit_no_connects`, and `debug_pins`; datasheet-recommended bypass values land in `recommended_bypass`; `extract_specs` propagates index-declared `vendor_aliases` as sourcing metadata.
- Add `MCP1700-1802E` to the linear-regulator catalog (1.8V sibling of the existing `MCP1700-3302E` entry) so `samples/oled_display_module` resolves without silent substitution.
- Add regression coverage: T228 synthesized-net and fail-closed paths, support-passive orphan-net exemptions, pin-name-inference-only SPI/UART repair, UART flow-control completion and NC fallback, imported-`pin_roles` crystal building, datasheet pin-table ingest flowing end-to-end through `build_generic`, and a catalog-wide sweep asserting every generic-dispatched entry emits no synthetic nets. Full suite: 1062 passed, 1 skipped.
- Fix the tag-triggered release workflow to install the full test extras without editable-mode dependency resolution drift, and queue the next sprint follow-up for Codex / Claude / OpenCode / Kilo compatibility config recovery.

## [0.30.52] - 2026-05-05

### Sprint 52 — Generation Pipeline Hardening

- Codify the part-neutral, vendor-agnostic, data/spec-driven direction in repo policy: add a root `CLAUDE.md` that tells future agents to prefer normalized schema + topology behavior over per-part engine branches.
- (T228) In progress — interface-heavy generic topologies now stop synthesizing NC phantom nets, default crystal nets to shared `XTAL_IN` / `XTAL_OUT` names, and hard-fail generation on unresolved declared-interface pins. The remaining work is the full removal of fallback per-instance signal nets in favor of normalized interface / pin-role routing across the rest of `build_generic`.
- (T229) Add a placement-readiness `orphan-net` gate for non-power nets consumed by only one block, with curated exemptions for test points, debug connectors, and connector-local USB-C control nets. Re-checking `I:/my_circuit/design.yaml` now keeps the placement-readiness total at `59` with `0` extra `orphan-net` false positives.
- (T230) Centralize generic IC decoupling policy under `auto_generate_bypass_caps`: `build_generic` no longer bakes in a blanket 100nF cap, the central pass now augments missing per-rail caps instead of skipping any component that already had one, and datasheet-driven `recommended_bypass` entries override the heuristic when present.
- (T231) Add weighted shared-net attraction to the PCB placement optimizer using a net-to-component map from `pcb_export`. `balanced` / `si` placement now penalizes long connected pairs instead of staying purely zone-based; on `samples/iot_sensor_node`, a high-weight connected pair (`RP1`↔`U4`) moved from `38.48 mm` apart in `simple` mode to `3.92 mm` in `balanced` mode.
- (T232) Lift placement-readiness gating into `generate_from_components`, add the single `readiness_gate` / `--no-readiness-gate` override path for debug emits, and turn `_classify_unhandled_pin(... level=\"error\")` into a hard generation failure instead of a logged no-connect. Direct runtime probes now confirm the gate blocks direct callers, the override reaches allocation, and floating power pins still hard-fail.
- (T233) Add normalized SPI/UART repair plumbing on top of the dedicated crystal-builder work: `generational_repair.py` now uses shared `pin_roles` metadata to complete floating SPI chip-select pins onto an existing unique CS net on the same bus and to complete missing UART TX/RX directions only when the peer net already exists. Optional flow-control / explicit-NC behavior is still open.
- (T234) Start turning catalog growth into a real schema pipeline: add normalized `pin_roles` to `ComponentDef`, cache payloads, `ic_data` conversion, EasyEDA imports, and generic-builder outputs so repairs/builders consume vendor-agnostic interface capabilities instead of exact MPN branches. The remaining work is broader datasheet/schema propagation plus acceptance-corpus coverage.
- Add a repo-local `tests/conftest.py` `tmp_path` override so focused pytest modules no longer depend on the broken Windows `tmp_path` / basetemp ACL path on this machine.

### Sprint 51 — Restart & Validation Hardening

- Add an installed-version banner to the `/circuit-weaver` startup flow and keep the repo-local and bundled `circuit-weaver` skills byte-identical. The skill now prefers `circuit-weaver --version` and falls back to `python -m circuit_weaver --version` only when needed.
- Add timeout-aware workflow guidance to `/circuit-weaver` and `/design_wizard`: long-running steps now require pre-announcement, follow-up checks around 2/5/15 minutes, and explicit log/status/issue inspection instead of letting work sit silent for ~30 minutes.
- Add canonical `validate` output-handling guidance to the workflow skills: the current CLI emits JSON to stdout by default, stderr must remain separate when parsing, `--json` should not be assumed, and the skills now include a safe capture/parsing recipe instead of brittle `2>&1 | json.load(...)` wrappers.
- Make restart state truthful for validate-only sessions: `log-status` no longer reports an empty workflow when a project only has validation activity, and persisted validation summaries now prefer the authoritative final report over the earlier raw-check pass.
- Harden Windows console validation output: text mode now falls back to ASCII `PASS` / `FAIL` when stdout cannot encode Unicode checkmark/cross glyphs, avoiding cp1252 `UnicodeEncodeError` crashes.
- Fail closed on bad component/template resolution: unknown data-driven `ic` selections now error instead of silently substituting the first database entry, `type: component` routes through the standalone resolver chain, handwritten templates again win over the generic JSON fallback when both exist, and `connector` now supports explicit `subtype: usb-a` resolution via `USB_A_4P`.
- Harden I2C auto-repair matching: synthetic pull-up repair now requires real SDA/SCL participant overlap, and hand-authored `i2c_bus` blocks suppress only the matching bus instead of disabling repair globally for every I2C bus in a design.
- Tighten placement-readiness interface semantics: passive support parts such as straps and bypass caps no longer count as true inter-block consumers, so orphan-interface checks stop being accidentally satisfied by support-only nets.
- Trim compile-path and warning debt: remove the dead duplicate shared-net synthesis helper from `dispatcher.py`, switch confidence-report timestamps to timezone-aware UTC, register the `network` pytest marker, and refresh stale import-site coverage around the renamed IR normalizer.
- Re-validate the live restart repro against the patched source: `I:/my_circuit/design.yaml` no longer produces the bogus barrel-jack `TIP_J2` / `RING_J2` connector artifacts or the repeated `USB_DP_*` substitution noise from unrelated components. The current remaining validation summary is `1 structural`, `59 electrical`, `9 implementation`, and `59 placement_readiness`; the remaining blockers are now exposed honestly instead of being masked by the old connector/template noise.

## [0.30.5] - 2026-05-04

### Sprint 50 — Generic Builder Parity Cleanup (T215–T218)

- Fix data-driven `sensor_frontend` dual-rail power handling: `build_generic()` now maps explicit `pin_vpos`/`pin_vneg` metadata to `vdd_net`/`gnd_net`, eliminating INA128PA floating power pins and reducing the full-suite failure count from 20 to 18.
- Preserve shared I2C/SPI net names in data-driven generation: add dedicated `i2c_bus` pull-up/level-shifter builders and map explicit SDA/SCL/SPI metadata to shared nets instead of per-instance `{PIN}_{REF}` names.
- Restore data-driven battery charger and fuel-gauge support networks: `battery_charger` and `battery_monitor` now emit PROG, STAT, CELL, QSTRT, I2C, bypass, and support-passive contracts without reintroducing legacy template classes.
- Restore data-driven display and passive diode contracts needed by the release gate: SSD1306-class display drivers now include reset, charge-pump, I2C/SPI, and support passives; diode/LED topologies now generate passive two-pin components without false power/GND requirements.
- Harden packaged/read-only workflows for the 0.30.5 release candidate: CLI commands now fall back to a writable log directory instead of crashing when the spec directory cannot host `circuit-weaver.log`, unreadable `~/.config/secrets.env` no longer aborts `doctor` or unknown-part fallback, and the bundled skill payload is resynced byte-identical with `skills/` for PyPI installs.
- Rework wizard intake by experience level: the offline `design-wizard` now captures experience before requirements, uses a compact design-brief path for advanced/professional users, and avoids the old one-size-fits-all opening questionnaire.
- Update Circuit Weaver workflow skills for the data-driven architecture: professional/specialized RF flows now route into research-first custom block definition instead of being framed as out-of-scope or template-gated, and the design-wizard/circuit-weaver docs now describe topology/block coverage rather than the old template-first mental model.
- Close the Sprint 50 release gate: full suite passes `1009 passed, 1 skipped, 6 warnings`; focused sample/presentation/generation gate passes `38 passed`; 9-archetype corpus hard-error gate passes `9 passed`. The external `I:/my_circuit` probe still validates with known placement-readiness errors and generation remains blocked by that design's pre-existing connectivity issues.

### Sprint 49 — Incremental Legacy Migration (T180–T182)

- Flip `SubcircuitRegistry.get()` to data-driven-first resolution order for all topologies; legacy templates serve as fallback when ic_data JSON has no entries.
- Remove `_DATA_DRIVEN_FIRST` class variable (dead code after flip).
- Add `test_registry_uses_data_driven_first` and `test_registry_legacy_fallback_when_no_ic_data`; replace old `test_registry_prefers_legacy_for_unported_topologies`.
- Catalog 26 test failures from boundary-port naming mismatches in verdict-B/C topologies (`build_generic` vs legacy). Buck/boost/buck_boost/ldo unaffected.
- Delete `subcircuits/buck.py`, `boost.py`, `buck_boost.py`, `ldo.py` — migrated to data-driven `DataDrivenTemplate` + topology builders with 34 parity tests (all pass). Remove registry import/register calls. Update test/script references to use registry-backed lookups via `get_default_registry().get()`.
- Delete remaining verdict-A legacy templates `can_transceiver.py`, `eeprom.py`, and `protection.py` after porting their contracts to data-driven builders. Add regression coverage for CAN net naming/options, EEPROM I2C/SPI strapping, and passive protection devices. Full-suite failures are reduced from 26 to 20; remaining failures are the pre-existing T180 boundary-port/generic-builder gaps.

## [0.30.3] - 2026-04-29

### Sprint 48 - Continued Release Validation

This patch collects follow-up fixes found while validating the v0.30.2 release
candidate on Windows, bundled sample designs, package builds, CLI validation,
confidence reports, and simulation command behavior.

### Fixed

- **Windows ERC CLI output:** `circuit-weaver erc` now prints ASCII `PASS` on
  success instead of a Unicode checkmark, avoiding cp1252 console crashes after
  successful ERC runs.
- **`register-ic` malformed custom data:** Single IC JSON objects that use
  `mpn`/`template_type` are now registered as one IC instead of being mistaken
  for a map of many ICs. Multi-IC maps reject scalar entries, and IC database
  accessors skip malformed custom entries instead of crashing validation.
- **Invalid `generate` CLI failures:** Expected hard-validation failures now
  return clean JSON error output with exit code 2 instead of surfacing an
  unhandled Python traceback.
- **Generic connector power nets:** `PIN_HEADER_2P`/`PIN_HEADER_4P` style
  generic connectors now honor explicit `positive_net` and `negative_net`
  fields before assigning `signal_nets`, so mixed power/signal headers do not
  create dangling `P*_REF` nets for their power pins.
- **Comparator template mode:** TLV3691-class comparator ICs now generate a
  threshold divider and output pull-up instead of op-amp feedback resistors
  when used as threshold detectors.
- **Battery-holder placeholder replacement:** Explicit 2xAA battery-input
  BARREL_JACK placeholders are upgraded to the standard KiCad
  `Battery:BatteryHolder_Keystone_2462_2xAA` footprint.
- **Footprint library readiness:** Generated footprint references are checked
  against local KiCad `.pretty` libraries, and missing custom/manufacturer
  footprints are emitted as implementation warnings with the searched install
  path and an official KiCad footprint-library browser URL.
- **Compact schematic paper size:** Connector-heavy compact boards now pack
  connector rails into two columns and avoid density spreading, keeping the
  `I:/my_circuit` Zigbee PIR/vibration schematic on A3 instead of A1.
- **Custom-footprint alternative policy:** Validation now distinguishes
  custom/missing footprint-library parts from standard KiCad-backed parts and
  can recommend curated footprint-backed alternatives when available.

### Validation

- Re-ran lint, tests, bundled sample validate/generate/ERC, confidence report,
  simulation command, doctor, and package build checks.
- Simulation command generates SPICE netlists but skips actual runs when
  optional `ngspice` is not installed, as expected.
- Removed stale bundled-skill `__pycache__` bytecode from package inputs after
  the first build attempted to include it in the wheel.
- Re-ran the real `I:/my_circuit/design.yaml` validation/generation/ERC probe
  from source into `I:/my_circuit/output_v0303_probe`; ERC reports 0 errors and
  0 warnings, and the schematic now uses A3. The probe still flags missing
  local footprint libraries for the E72 module and EKMB PIR sensor with KiCad
  library/manufacturer-import guidance.
- Rebuilt the source and wheel distributions after the final fixes; inspected
  the wheel and found 0 `__pycache__` or bytecode artifacts.

## [0.30.2] - 2026-04-28

### Sprint 45-47 - Output Bug Fixes, Coverage, and Safe Migration Planning

This patch release addresses the issues found in the `I:/my_circuit/output/`
review: over-promoted schematic paper size, warning records mislabeled as
errors in `design.log`, and redundant validation generation passes. It also
closes the remaining Sprint 42/T191 dedicated-test gaps for allocator and
placement-readiness logic, finishes Sprint 46 short-runner coverage, and
revalidates the Sprint 47 legacy-template migration boundary.

### Fixed

- **Schematic paper over-promotion:** `layout_sheet()` now starts from the
  allocator-selected paper size and only promotes if that size does not fit.
  This prevents small IoT-sensor-class designs from cascading to A2 because
  density-scaled gaps grow with paper area. The fit gate also uses a tighter
  clearance above KiCad's reserved title block, keeping `IoT_AQ_Sensor_v2` on
  A3 instead of over-promoting to A2.
- **Design log severity:** `DesignLogHandler` now maps Python `WARNING`
  records to `type: "warning"` entries instead of `type: "error"`. Error and
  critical records still use `type: "error"`.
- **Generate overhead:** `validate_design(check_determinism=False)` allows
  `generate_artifacts()` to skip the dual deterministic-generation pass. A
  `generate` run now performs one validation smoke generation plus the real
  output generation, not three full generations.

### Added

- **Placement-readiness tests:** New `tests/test_placement_readiness.py` covers
  promoted validator codes, suggestion fallback behavior, orphan-interface
  detection, power-net exclusions, self-only net handling, and report
  serialization.
- **Allocator tests:** New `tests/test_allocator.py` covers paper thresholds,
  category/ref/description classification, small-design single-sheet behavior,
  passive-sheet merging, review-sheet partitioning, sort order, paper
  recomputation after merge, and annotation de-duplication.
- **JLCPCB assembly variants:** `generate_assembly_variants()` supports simple
  `include_refs`, `exclude_refs`, and `dnp_refs` assembly subsets. Optional
  `export_jlcpcb(..., assembly_variants=[...])` writes per-variant BOM/CPL
  files alongside the default BOM/CPL.
- **Sprint 46 tests:** Added coverage for sourcing alternate suggestions,
  mocked PDF datasheet parsing/extraction, JLCPCB price-break detection, and
  assembly-variant export.
- **Sprint 47 audit:** Re-ran `scripts/audit_legacy_templates.py`. Result is
  unchanged: A=7, B=21, C=9. Full legacy deletion remains unsafe for v0.30.2;
  the registry stays data-driven-first only for verified topologies.
- **BME688 bundled IC data:** Added BME688 sensor pin/footprint metadata to the
  bundled IC database so `IoT_AQ_Sensor_v2` no longer depends on local
  `custom.json` registration state.
- **Local workflow ignores:** Stopped tracking unused local OpenCode/KiCad agent
  workflow files and added ignore rules for them.

### Tests

- Added `tests/test_allocator.py` (28 tests).
- Added `tests/test_placement_readiness.py` (24 tests).
- Added `tests/test_logging_bridge_levels.py` (6 tests).
- Added `tests/test_validate_determinism_flag.py` (4 tests).
- Added `tests/test_jlcpcb_export.py` (7 tests).
- Expanded `tests/test_placer.py`, `tests/test_sourcing_auditor.py`, and
  `tests/test_spec_harvester.py`.

## [0.30.1] - 2026-04-28

### Sprint 44.1 — Cache Fix + Test Coverage

OpenCode's non-deterministic sub-agent prompt construction breaks DeepSeek's
prefix-based prompt caching, causing high cache-miss costs. This release
disables the oh-my-openagent plugin (which injected per-turn mode tags and
todo-continuation prompts) and adds dedicated test coverage for four
previously untested modules.

#### Cache-Friendly Workflow

- **Plugin:** Removed `oh-my-openagent` from `opencode.json` plugin list
  to stop per-turn directive injection that changed the prompt prefix on
  every request.
- **Docs:** Added `docs/cache-friendly-agents.md` — codifies cache-hit-first
  operating principles: reuse `task_id` sessions, avoid sub-agents for
  trivial work, keep `AGENTS.md`/`rules/kicad.md` small and stable, audit
  plugins for per-turn injection.
- **AGENTS.md:** New rule referencing the cache doc before adding any
  plugin, sub-agent, or per-turn directive.

#### New Test Modules (46 tests total)

- **`tests/test_api.py`** (16 tests): Smoke tests for all 9 FastAPI endpoint
  groups — `/health`, `/templates`, `/validate`, `/generate`,
  `/generate/from-bom`, `/mvp/validate`, `/mvp/apply-patch`, `/mvp/diff`,
  `/mvp/pcb-feedback`, `/mvp/generate`.
- **`tests/test_placer.py`** (16 tests): Smoke tests for all 6 public
  placer functions — `layout_sheet`, `reset_ref_counters`,
  `component_block_size`, `component_body_size`, `component_body_bounds`,
  `component_annotation_start_y`.
- **`tests/test_thermal.py`** (6 tests): Smoke tests for
  `analyze_thermal` and `generate_heatmap_svg` — full IoT sensor spec,
  placements, custom ambient temp, empty components, SVG output.
- **`tests/test_si_constraints.py`** (8 tests): Smoke tests for
  `analyze_si_constraints` — USB bus detection from pins and descriptions,
  impedance constraints, differential pairs, routing rules.

#### Known Limitations

- OpenCode upstream issue: sub-agent prompt construction is non-deterministic
  (agent list not sorted). This must be fixed upstream in OpenCode for full
  cache-hit optimization. Tracked in the cache doc.

## [0.30.0] - 2026-04-27

### Sprint 44 — CI Gate Repair & Label Collision Prevention

Generated schematics previously could have overlapping labels on dense
sheets, the CI gate was blind to sample regressions (zigbee_humidistat
skipped), and several code quality items from the Sprint 42 backlog
remained unaddressed. This release closes all of those gaps.

### Added

- **Validate-all regression gate** (T186): `test_corpus_validate_no_hard_errors`
  parametrized test asserting zero hard errors across all 9 corpus samples.
  All 14+1 sample YAMLs now validate clean.
- **Label collision avoidance pass** (T196):
  `primitives._resolve_label_collisions()` detects overlapping label
  bounding boxes on the same orientation axis and shifts labels along
  their wire-stub direction by 2.54mm increments, extending the
  connecting wire. Same-name labels are skipped. Wired into
  `assemble_sheet()` before dedup.
- **VUSB power rail detection** (T186): Added `VUSB` to
  `POWER_NET_PREFIXES` in `subcircuits/base.py`.
- **Sourcing auditor alternate suggestion** (T189):
  `sourcing_auditor._suggest_alternates()` queries LCSC/DigiKey for
  functionally similar parts when a component has CRITICAL/WARNING
  risk level.
- **JLCPCB price-break detection** (T192): `_detect_price_breaks()`
  in `jlcpcb_export.py` queries LCSC pricing and flags components
  where ordering qty 100 saves ≥ 20% vs qty 1. Alerts appended to
  assembly README.
- **MCP server for AI agent tool access** (T194):
  `src/circuit_weaver/mcp_server.py` — FastMCP-based server exposing
  `validate_design`, `generate_artifacts`, `discover_projects`, and
  `research_component` tools. Entry point: `circuit-weaver-mcp`.
- **Wire-crossing minimization** (T193): `_count_wire_crossings()`
  in `placer.py` counts horizontal/vertical wire intersections and
  penalises crossing-dense placements via `_layout_score()`.
  `_bus_net_groups()` detects bus signal groups (4+ numbered nets
  with shared prefix) for future parallel routing.
- **18 new regression tests** for `datasheet_parser.py` covering
  thermal, voltage, and parametric regex extraction (T190).
- **12 new regression tests** for `generational_repair.py` covering
  I2C pull-up auto-repair pipeline (T191).

### Changed

- **`design_loader.py`** extracted from `dispatcher.py` (T187):
  `compile_design_ir()` and its 300-line support pipeline moved to
  a new module. Backward-compatible import re-exported from dispatcher.
- **`sexpr_builder.py`** extracted from `generator.py` (T188):
  symbol property normalizers and S-expression balance validator
  moved to a new module. Backward-compatible imports from generator.
- **`zigbee_humidistat.yaml`** (T186): Added `pin_nets_extra` for
  EN/IN pins, USB-C-PWR connector block to drive VUSB.
- **CI `validate-design.yml`** (T186): Removed zigbee_humidistat skip.
- **`_layout_score()`** in `placer.py` (T193): Now includes a
  wire-crossing penalty term in the placement score.

### Fixed

- **VUSB now recognized as a power rail** by `_is_power_net()`
  (T186). Previously caused `orphan-interface` and `undriven-net`
  errors on USB-powered designs without a modeled connector.

### Tests

- Added `test_corpus_validate_no_hard_errors` (9 parametrized cases).
- Added `tests/test_datasheet_parser.py` (18 tests).
- Added `tests/test_generational_repair.py` (12 tests).
- Full suite: **853 passed, 19 skipped, 0 failed**. Ruff clean.

## [0.29.1] - 2026-04-27

### Sprint 43 — Schematic Density & Readability

Generated schematics suffered from annotation overlap on dense sheets,
unbounded lane routing drift, and corner-clustering of components on
large paper sizes. The initial v0.29.0 shipped an auto-sheet-splitting
approach that was reverted in this release in favor of density-scaled
grid spacing — a simpler, safer fix that spreads components across the
available page area without introducing cross-sheet connectivity
complexity.

### Changed

- **Density-scaled grid spacing** (Task 201, replaces T195).
  `_density_scaled_gaps()` in `placer.py` scales inter-component
  column and row gaps so that components spread across the available
  page area instead of clustering in a corner. When a large sheet
  (A0/A1) has a modest number of ICs, the row/col gaps are
  multiplied up to 3.0x so content fills ~30-40% of the page. On
  already-dense sheets (fill > 35%), gaps stay at their base
  values. Wired into all three component groups in
  `_build_layout()`: connectors, regulators, and other ICs.
  Module-level: no new constants needed — the scaling is fully
  automatic based on component footprint area vs page area.

### Changed (from v0.29.0)

- **Auto sheet splitting reverted** (was T195 in v0.29.0).
  `allocator.py` restored to v0.28.3 baseline. Sheet splitting
  created cross-sheet readability issues (connected ICs spanning
  different sub-sheets) and root-sheet scaling concerns for no
  meaningful benefit over density-scaled spacing.
- **Annotation overlap prevention** (Task 197, kept from v0.29.0).
- **Lane routing counter recycling** (Task 198, kept from v0.29.0).

### Deferred

- **Label collision avoidance** (Task 196) deferred to Sprint 44.

### Tests

- Added `tests/test_density_scaling.py` — 5 tests covering no-scaling
  for small/dense sheets, scaling on large sparse sheets, < 3
  component skip, and grid-snap idempotency.
- Removed `tests/test_allocator.py` (reverted with T195).

### Files

`src/circuit_weaver/placer.py`, `src/circuit_weaver/generator.py`,
`tests/test_density_scaling.py`, `pyproject.toml`,
`src/circuit_weaver/__init__.py`, `tests/test_bootstrap.py`

Full suite: 832 passed, 1 skipped, 0 failed. Lint: clean.

## [0.29.0] - 2026-04-27

### Sprint 43 — Initial attempt (reverted in 0.29.1)

- Auto sheet splitting (T195) — reverted in 0.29.1 in favor of density-scaled spacing.
- Annotation overlap prevention (T197) — kept.
- Lane routing counter recycling (T198) — kept.
- Label collision avoidance (T196) — deferred.

## [0.28.0] - 2026-04-26

### Sprint 41 — Resolver + Template UX Follow-ups

Two related failure modes surfaced by a user running the design wizard
on a novel IC (RP2040-based toy phone):

### Fixed

- **`SymbolResolver` now caches negative resolutions for the life of the
  process** (Task 175). A design with N identical unresolvable parts
  triggers 1 tier-chain walk, not N. The toy_phone 12-button matrix
  (`TS-1187A-B-A-B`) went from 12 DigiKey round trips per validate to
  1. `SymbolResolver.clear_unresolved_cache()` exposed for
  long-running callers that want to retry after a transient flap.
- **Legacy topology templates now honor `register-ic` pin maps**
  (Task 176). `USBControllerTemplate`, `ConnectorTemplate`,
  `USBCConnectorTemplate`, and `EEPROMTemplate` previously only
  consulted their own hardcoded `*_IC_DATABASE`. Registering a novel
  MPN (e.g. RP2040 as a `usb_controller`) silently fell back to the
  template's default IC, so the net-connectivity validator flagged
  `USB_DP` dangling even though the user's registered pin map put
  pin 43 on USB_DP. Each template now merges `ic_data` entries
  matching its topology via `merge_into_legacy_db()` — same pattern
  `audio_amplifier` / `motor_driver` / `protection` use.
  `USBControllerTemplate.generate()` also honors explicit
  `pin_usb_dp` / `pin_usb_dm` number fields from the JSON
  registration, falling back to `D_P` / `D_N` / `USB_DP` / `USB_DM`
  pin-name matching. Remaining ~25 legacy templates with hardcoded
  DBs tracked as Sprint 42 cleanup.
- **Placement preview `.kicad_pcb` files now use KiCad's fixed 2-layer
  hash** (Task 177). `pcb_export.py` had been emitting a KiCad-5-era
  hardcoded layer table (`B.Cu=31`, `ECO1.User`, `ECO2.User`) that
  KiCad 10 rejects on load with `Layer ECO1.User ... is not fixed layer
  hash`. The placement board now uses KiCad's canonical layer ids and
  names (`B.Cu=2`, `Eco1.User`, `Eco2.User`, plus `User.1-User.4`),
  so `*_placement.kicad_pcb` opens again as the intended layout hint.

### Tests

- Added `test_unresolved_mpn_is_cached_within_process` and
  `test_unresolved_cache_does_not_shadow_successful_resolutions` in
  `tests/test_resolver_chain.py` (Task 175).
- Added `test_usb_controller_hotload_via_register_ic`,
  `test_usb_controller_generate_wires_registered_ic_usb_pins`,
  `test_connector_hotload_via_register_ic`,
  `test_usb_c_connector_hotload_via_register_ic`,
  `test_eeprom_hotload_via_register_ic` in
  `tests/test_legacy_template_hotload.py` (Task 176).
- Added `test_preview_pcb_uses_kicad_fixed_layer_ids` in
  `tests/test_pcb_preview_invariants.py` (Task 177).
- Added `tests/test_template_smoke.py` — 74 tests iterating every
  template in the default registry, asserting (a) merged IC DB is
  non-empty, (b) `generate()` returns at least one ComponentDef.
  Covers the 28+ templates the 9-archetype corpus doesn't exercise
  (Task 178).
- Full suite: **825 passed, 1 skipped, 0 failed**.

### Fixed (continued)

- **Every hardcoded `*_IC_DATABASE` dict drained into
  `ic_data/*.json`** (Task 178). All 84 IC entries across 37 legacy
  subcircuit-template databases now live in JSON, tagged with the
  correct topology so every template's merge view resolves them.
  New `subcircuits.base.LegacyDBProxy` provides a dict-like shim so
  existing template code reading `XYZ_IC_DATABASE[key]` / `.get()` /
  `in` / `.keys()` works unchanged against a live JSON view —
  `register_ic()` entries become visible on the next access, no
  process restart needed. Subtype info that used to ride on
  `topology` (`low_side`/`high_side`, `series`/`shunt`, `buck`/
  `linear_sink`) is preserved as `topology_subtype`; the 3 templates
  that dispatched on it (`mosfet_switch`, `voltage_reference`,
  `led_driver`) now read the new field. 8 duplicate MPNs living in
  two JSON files (including `AT25SF128A` as both `component` and
  `eeprom`) deduped — topology-specific entry wins, generic
  `component` copy removed.

### Sprint 41 — Circuit Validity Generational Requirements

Completes the generational-requirements story started in Sprint 40. A
user can now describe a "dynamic and vastly different" circuit in YAML
and get a guaranteed placement-ready `.kicad_sch` back — dangling
buses, missing I2C pull-ups, floating enables, orphan interfaces, and
unverified-stub ICs are either auto-repaired in place or raise a hard
generation error with a specific fix suggestion.

### Added

- **New `placement_readiness` validation category** (`placement_readiness.py`)
  that promotes every placement-blocking check — `single-pin-net`,
  `undriven-net`, `i2c-missing-pullup`, `spi-floating-cs`,
  `uart-unpaired`, `floating-enable`, `floating-power-pin`,
  `unverified-pinout`, plus a new `orphan-interface` detector — into a
  hard category that `generate_artifacts` always blocks on.
  `_HARD_ERROR_CATEGORIES` is now
  `{structural, implementation, placement_readiness}`; soft electrical
  warnings remain bypassable via `--no-require-valid`.
- **`generational_repair.py`** auto-repair pass. Runs inside
  `compile_design_ir` after primary resolution, synthesizes a
  PULLUPS_ONLY I2C bus block when a named I2C bus lacks pull-ups, and
  records each fix in `placement_readiness.json`. Users opt out via
  `auto_repair: false` at the top of the spec.
- **Surgical per-IC YAML overrides** (`project_spec._apply_partial_pin_overrides`):
  `pin_nets_extra`, `power_pins_extra`, and `no_connects` merge onto
  registry defaults so users can rewire an MCU's I2C pins or mark an
  unused UART NC without re-declaring every other pin via `pin_map`.
  Stale template boundary ports retire automatically when their net is
  replaced.
- **`_synthesize_shared_net_interfaces`**: every non-power signal that
  shares a net across two or more blocks now gets an auto-declared
  `DesignInterface`, satisfying the MVP's `undeclared-shared-net`
  gate without user boilerplate.
- **Four new corpus archetypes** (`samples/`) — `inverter_gate_driver`,
  `wearable_bms`, `rf_frontend`, `high_voltage_isolation` — closing
  out the Sprint 40 follow-up archetype list.
- **`placement_readiness.json`** artifact written alongside
  `validation_report.json` in every `generate` output. Shape:
  `{ready: bool, blocking: [...], auto_repaired: [...], summary: {...}}`.

### Changed

- **`_bus_pairs` relaxed** to trigger on any named I2C bus with at
  least one participant (previously required ≥ 2). A lone sensor on
  `I2C_SDA` still needs pull-ups; the new detector covers that case.
- **`_build_net_pin_map` in the validator** now models bypass caps and
  strap resistors as full 2-terminal elements — a pull-up net no
  longer reads as single-pin just because the only "real" IC pin on
  it is the one the strap attaches to.
- **`_POWER_NET_PREFIXES`** expanded with `VBAT`, `VSS`, `AGND`,
  `DGND`, `PGND` so battery-only rails aren't flagged as
  `undeclared-shared-net`.
- **`design_ir_to_engine_spec`** preserves `block.ic` on template
  blocks, fixing a pre-existing bug where a user-selected IC (e.g.
  `ic: CH340G` on a `usb_controller`) silently fell back to the
  template's first default (CYUSB3014).
- **Existing samples fixed to be placement-ready**: `iot_sensor_node`,
  `battery_iot_sensor`, `motor_controller`, `usb_uart_bridge`,
  `oled_display_module`, and the built-in `examples/iot_sensor.yaml`
  now use the new surgical overrides to wire their MCU I2C / SWD /
  UART pins cleanly.

### Tests

- **9-archetype corpus**: `tests/test_generation_corpus.py` now runs
  `generate_artifacts` over 9 samples and enforces a fourth invariant:
  `placement_readiness.json` reports `ready: true`. Breadth guard
  raised from ≥ 5 to ≥ 9.
- Added `test_auto_repair_inserts_i2c_pullups` and
  `test_auto_repair_disabled_via_spec_flag` covering Task B directly.
- Full suite at sprint close: **743 passed, 1 skipped, 0 failed**.

### Sprint 40 — Generation Quality Regression Repair

Repaired regressions introduced during the dynamic IC designer, placement
pipeline, and schematic density work. Every fix landed behind a
diverse-circuit regression corpus so follow-on generator work can't silently
break these subsystems again.

### Added

- **Placement preview clarity**: `placement.kicad_pcb` now self-identifies
  as `(generator "schematic_engine placement_preview")` and uses
  `Placement_Preview:Missing_<ref>` placeholders when a footprint binding
  is absent — no more silent SOIC-8 fallbacks that look fabricatable.
- **`report.verify_report_fidelity(report_text, components)`** —
  diagnostic that catches references to component refs, nets, or
  annotations that don't exist in the resolved design (Task 172).
- **`symbol_cache.component_def_to_cache_payload()`** helper — serializes a
  ComponentDef with full pin / power / bypass / strap topology so cache
  entries round-trip as trusted on the next session (Task 169).
- **Five-archetype generation corpus**
  (`tests/test_generation_corpus.py`): LED driver, IoT sensor, motor
  controller, USB bridge, FPGA power carrier. Each runs `generate` end-to-
  end and enforces schematic / PCB / report invariants (Task 174).

### Changed

- **Cache-rebuilt components without pin data are now flagged
  `pinout_source="stub"`**, so the existing `pinout-source` validator
  correctly rejects multi-pin ICs that would otherwise ship as silent
  2-pin passives. This is the class of bug the IoT AQ audit hit on
  BME688 / LED1 / SW1 — fixed at the resolver so every user's cached
  parts are covered, not just one design (Task 169).
- **`assemble_sheet` now dedupes structural duplicates before emission**:
  symbol instances by `(lib_id, ref, at, uuid)`, wires by sorted
  endpoints, labels by `(kind, text, at)`, no-connects / junctions by
  position. Catches any upstream double-emission in the placer /
  topology dispatchers (Task 170).
- **`generate_artifacts` enforcement is now deterministic across runs**:
  structural + implementation category errors always raise, regardless
  of `require_valid`. `--no-require-valid` now only bypasses soft
  electrical warnings, and that bypass is logged at WARNING level
  (Task 173).

### Fixed

- **PCB placement preview no longer fabricates wrong footprints or
  synthetic pads** — previously any non-recognized footprint fell back to
  SOIC-8, and every footprint got exactly two 1.27-pitch SMD pads
  synthesized regardless of real pad count. ESP32 modules shipped with 2
  pads, barrel jacks with 0. Now the preview emits reference locations
  only — KiCad's schematic→PCB forward annotation is the authoritative
  source of pads (Task 171).

### Tests

- Added `tests/test_schematic_invariants.py` — reusable
  `assert_schematic_invariants()` helper + reproducer test that would
  detect the IoT AQ regression (Task 170).
- Added `tests/test_pcb_preview_invariants.py` — 3 tests proving the
  preview PCB never fabricates footprints or synthetic pads (Task 171).
- Added `tests/test_report_fidelity.py` — 5 tests covering clean report,
  ghost refs, ghost nets, annotation ghost claims, reconstructed IoT AQ
  audit scenario (Task 172).
- Added `tests/test_generate_enforcement.py` — 4 tests proving hard
  validation errors can't be bypassed via `--no-require-valid`, soft
  warnings can, verdicts are deterministic across runs (Task 173).
- Added `tests/test_generation_corpus.py` — 6 tests (5 archetypes + 1
  breadth guard) running full `generate_artifacts` pipeline with
  invariants (Task 174).
- Added 3 new cases to `tests/test_resolver_chain.py` covering cache
  stub flagging, full-topology cache round-trip, and validator
  integration (Task 169).
- Full suite at sprint close: **737 passed, 1 skipped, 0 failed**.

### Sprint 39 — Research Workflow Compatibility

### Fixed

- **Step 2 IC research guidance now stays in the current agent session** for
  Codex / Claude / OpenCode workflows instead of steering `sonar-pro` users
  into delegated `/research` / `research-analyst` paths that can trigger model
  conflicts. The docs now tell agents to fall back to native web tooling in the
  same session and persist the backend that actually ran.

### Changed

- **Research backend help text and persistence docs now describe the generic
  research workflow**, not a specific subagent implementation. README, workflow
  docs, and skill prompts were synchronized to match the real behavior.
- **Research workflow now has a latency selector**. `design-wizard` can persist
  `research_depth={fast,normal}` into spec metadata, `doctor` reports the
  effective depth, and the Circuit Weaver skill uses a smaller query budget in
  `fast` mode.

## [0.26.1] - 2026-04-22

### Fixed

- **Resolver credential checks now honor the real credential sources** used by
  the loaders (`env` or `secrets.env`) instead of looking only at process
  environment variables. DigiKey now treats both `DIGIKEY_CLIENT_ID` and
  `DIGIKEY_CLIENT_SECRET` as required for the tier, and Mouser honors
  `MOUSER_SEARCH_API_KEY` from the shared credential loader as well.
- **`circuit-weaver doctor` now surfaces DigiKey and Mouser credential status**,
  so the Task 156 skip message ("Run `circuit-weaver doctor` to configure")
  now points users to actionable diagnostics.
- **Saved research artifacts are now traceable from `design.log`**. Research
  entries include the effective backend and the canonical `{project}/research/{slug}.json`
  path written by `save-research`.

### Changed

- **`design-wizard --research-backend ...` now persists the effective backend**
  into the scaffolded spec metadata and the initial `design.log` step, so the
  downstream Codex / Claude / OpenCode workflow can actually honor the selector.
- **`skills/circuit-weaver/SKILL.md` and `README.md` now describe the real
  research workflow**: resolve backend first, use native web tooling for
  `standard`, and persist every run through `circuit-weaver save-research`.

### Tests

- Added regression coverage for DigiKey secret handling, credential-loader based
  resolver fallback, doctor credential reporting, `design.log` research artifact
  paths, and `design-wizard` research-backend persistence.
- Full suite at release cut: **708 passed, 1 skipped, 0 failed**.

## [0.26.0] - 2026-04-22

### Sprint 37 — Observability, Research Pipeline & Resolver Polish

Three categories bundled into one release, all driven by user reports
against v0.25.x.

### Added — Observability (Task 159, user-reported)

- **`circuit-weaver.log` now covers every subcommand**, not just `generate`. The
  dispatcher calls `init_logging_for_cli(args.command, args)` before dispatching,
  so `validate`, `confidence`, `simulate`, `erc`, `cost-bom`, `export-*`, etc.
  all produce a log file in the project directory.
- **Log directory heuristics:** file-style `--output` (e.g. `report.html`) →
  log to its parent dir; directory-style → log to that dir; otherwise fall back
  to the spec file's parent (so `validate design.yaml` with no `--output`
  still writes next to the YAML). Administrative commands (`doctor`,
  `discover`, `list-templates`, `cache`, `install-skills`, ...) skip file
  logging entirely to avoid littering CWD.
- **`log_workflow_step(command, step, message, details)`** helper emits
  `[command:step]` markers to both `circuit-weaver.log` and `design.log`.
  Handlers for `validate`, `generate`, and `save-research` now mark
  their entry points.
- **`CIRCUIT_WEAVER_LOG_LEVEL`** env var controls root level (default
  `INFO`; set `DEBUG` for byte-level trace).
- **Resolver tier resolution is now INFO-level** (was DEBUG) so users
  see which MPN resolved via which tier without enabling debug mode.

### Added — Research pipeline (Tasks 160 & 161, user-reported)

- **`circuit-weaver save-research`** new CLI subcommand. Reads a JSON
  payload from stdin or `--file`, writes `{project_dir}/research/{slug}.json`,
  `{slug}.md`, and a rebuilt `summary.md` index. Structured record
  includes: topic, query, backend, summary, findings (mpn/cost/notes),
  citations (title/url/snippet), timestamp.
- **`src/circuit_weaver/research_store.py`** new module: atomic-write
  persistence (`tmp`→rename), markdown renderer, summary-index rebuild,
  `list_research_topics()` for downstream tooling.
- **`--research-backend {auto,sonar-pro,standard}` on `design-wizard`**,
  plus `CIRCUIT_WEAVER_RESEARCH_BACKEND` env var. `auto` (default) picks
  `sonar-pro` when `PERPLEXITY_API_KEY` is set, else `standard` (Claude
  native WebSearch). Requesting `sonar-pro` without a key degrades to
  `standard` with an INFO log rather than crashing.
- **`src/circuit_weaver/research.py`** new module: `resolve_backend()`
  + `backend_info()` for the selection logic.
- **`doctor` reports research backend** — effective backend, whether
  `PERPLEXITY_API_KEY` is set, env var state.

### Added — Resolver polish (Tasks 156, 157, 158)

- **Task 156 — credential skip visibility:** `SymbolResolver` emits one
  INFO log per session when DigiKey or Mouser tier is skipped because
  `DIGIKEY_CLIENT_ID` / `MOUSER_SEARCH_API_KEY` is unset. Dedupe cache
  prevents spamming the log on large designs.
- **Task 157 — hermetic end-to-end regression test:** `tests/test_resolver_e2e.py`
  runs the user-reported Zigbee air-sensor YAML (SHT41 / SGP40 / nRF52840)
  through the full chain with mocked `load_from_digikey`. Asserts no MPN
  falls to a stub when a tier should have caught it.
- **Task 158 — legacy templates honour `register_ic()`:** `audio_amplifier`,
  `motor_driver`, and `protection` now merge `ic_data` entries for their
  topology into their hardcoded `*_IC_DATABASE` dicts via `ic_data.merge_into_legacy_db`.
  Users can now `register_ic("TEST-NEW-TVS", {...})` and have the new IC
  resolve through the legacy `type: protection` template as well as
  `DataDrivenTemplate`.

### Fixed

- `ic_data.merge_into_legacy_db` converts dict-shaped pin entries to
  `PinDef` instances so legacy `generate()` paths (which iterate pins as
  dataclass objects) don't choke on user-registered JSON.

### Tests

- **`tests/test_logging_workflow.py`** — 10 tests covering log-dir
  resolution, CLI subcommand log file creation, workflow markers, and
  `CIRCUIT_WEAVER_LOG_LEVEL=DEBUG` propagation.
- **`tests/test_research_store.py`** — 16 tests covering slugify, JSON
  persistence, Markdown rendering, summary index, atomic write, and CLI.
- **`tests/test_research_backend.py`** — 12 tests covering backend
  resolution precedence, env-var handling, and doctor integration.
- **`tests/test_resolver_e2e.py`** — 2 end-to-end tests locking in the
  Zigbee air-sensor user scenario with mocked DigiKey.
- **`tests/test_legacy_template_hotload.py`** — 4 tests proving
  `register_ic()` entries flow into audio_amplifier / motor_driver /
  protection template classes.
- **Task 156 regression test** added to `tests/test_resolver_chain.py` —
  asserts exactly one "DigiKey tier skipped" INFO log per session.

**Total: 702 passed, 1 skipped, 0 failed. Ruff clean.**

---

## [0.25.0] - 2026-04-22

### Sprint 35 — Install-UX hardening & platform parity

Closes three P0 footguns identified in the v0.24.x review.

### Added
- **`circuit-weaver install-skills` collision protection** — an existing `SKILL.md` with content different from the bundled source is now left untouched by default. The command reports each skipped skill and exits with status `partial`. New flags:
  - `--force` — overwrite existing `SKILL.md` files that differ from source
  - `--backup` — when overwriting, preserve the prior `SKILL.md` as `SKILL.md.bak.YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS`
  - `--dry-run` — walk the install plan without touching the filesystem
  - Result dict now includes `skills_skipped` and `skills_unchanged`
- **`scripts/sync_bundled_skills.py`** — keeps `src/circuit_weaver/_bundled_skills/` in sync with `skills/`. Run with `--check` in CI / pre-commit to fail on drift.
- **`bundled-skills` CI job** in `.github/workflows/ci.yml` — verifies parity between `skills/` and `_bundled_skills/` on every push.
- **`sync-bundled-skills` pre-commit hook** — prevents divergence at author time.
- **Windows CI leg** (`windows-latest` / Python 3.12, currently non-blocking) — smoke-tests CLI commands, doctor, skill installer, and `python -m circuit_weaver --version`.

### Changed
- **Bundled skills now include all 11 workflow skills** (`bom`, `circuit-weaver`, `design_wizard`, `digikey`, `ee`, `jlcpcb`, `kicad`, `lcsc`, `mouser`, `pcbway`, `vivado`). Previously only the stale `circuit-weaver` skill (410 of 651 lines) shipped in the PyPI wheel.
- `README.md` and `docs/agent-platforms.md` now describe the collision policy and new flags.

### Tests
- `tests/test_skill_installer.py` — 12 new tests covering collision skip, force overwrite, backup, dry-run, unchanged no-op, and bundled-parity.

### Sprint 36 — Resolver Chain Fix

Fixes the reason v0.24.x stubbed common parts (SHT41-AD1B-R2, SGP40-D-R4, nRF52840) that were available on DigiKey, Mouser, and in `ic_data` JSON — the standalone-component resolver never looked there.

### Fixed
- **`project_spec._resolve_component`** now delegates to `SymbolResolver`. Previously it had an ad-hoc 3-tier chain (ComponentRegistry → KiCad lib → EasyEDA) that ignored the cache, DigiKey, Mouser, and the `ic_data` JSON store that shipped in v0.24.0. Any MPN not in one of those three tiers became a stub, even if DigiKey/Mouser carried it.
- **`ic_data.register_ic()` deadlock** — the function held `_db_lock` while calling `_get_db()`, which also tries to acquire the same non-reentrant lock. First call to `register_ic()` after `reload()` hung indefinitely. Fixed by resolving the db reference before acquiring the mutation lock.

### Added
- **`SymbolResolver` Tier 2: ic_data JSON store** — resolver now consults `ic_data.get_ic_data()` between `ComponentRegistry` (Tier 1) and the KiCad library (Tier 3). The 7-tier chain is now: registry → ic_data → kicad_lib → cache → easyeda → digikey → mouser → unresolved.
- **`ic_data.ic_data_to_component_def(mpn, data)`** — converts a JSON IC entry into a `ComponentDef` with pins, footprint, power_pins auto-derived from power_in pin types, and topology-based category/ref_prefix mapping. Returns `None` for entries that lack a usable `pins` list.
- **Stub reason now enumerates all 7 tiers** — so the diagnostic output makes it obvious what was tried and what the user can register to fix it.

### Tests
- **`tests/test_resolver_chain.py`** — 6 regression tests: registry-wins-first, ic_data-resolves-template-part (DS3231), register_ic-hot-load-visible-immediately, DigiKey-rescues-unknown-MPN (mocked SHT41-AD1B-R2), project_spec-delegates-to-SymbolResolver, unresolved-falls-to-informative-stub.

## [0.24.1] - 2026-04-22

### Sprint 34 — Follow-up hardening

Post-release review follow-ups for the data-driven template engine. No
functional changes to generated schematics.

### Changed
- **`register_ic()`** now writes atomically via tmp-file rename, preventing a corrupted `custom.json` if the process is interrupted
- **`register_ic()`** falls back to the user data directory (`$XDG_DATA_HOME/circuit-weaver/custom.json` on POSIX, `%APPDATA%/circuit-weaver/custom.json` on Windows) when the installed package directory is read-only — previously raised `PermissionError` on system/container Python installs
- **IC data loader** now merges `custom.json` overlays from both the package and user data dirs
- **`_get_db()`** lazy initialization is now thread-safe via `threading.Lock` (double-checked locking)

### Added
- **USB-C `source_current` param** (`usb_c_connector.py`): when `role="source"`, selects Rp per USB-C Rev 2.1 Table 4-25 — `"default"` → 56k (USB 2.0 / 500 mA), `"1.5A"` → 22k, `"3A"` → 10k. Previous behavior (56k) remains the default.

### Fixed
- **CHANGELOG v0.24.0**: removed inaccurate claim that `audio_amplifier.py`, `motor_driver.py`, `protection.py` had been migrated to the data-driven builder path. The `DataDrivenTemplate` infrastructure is in place and serves as a registry fallback, but migration of those three legacy modules is deferred to a follow-up sprint.

## [0.24.0] - 2026-04-21

### Sprint 34 — Data-Driven Template Engine

This release replaces the hardcoded subcircuit template classes with a JSON-driven IC data system plus dynamic topology builders, and expands the template library from 30 to 37 entries.

### Added
- **`src/circuit_weaver/ic_data/`** (new package): 11 JSON files — `amplifier.json`, `bus_interface.json`, `connector.json`, `converter.json`, `custom.json`, `linear_regulator.json`, `memory.json`, `misc.json`, `oscillator.json`, `protection.json`, `switching_regulator.json` — storing IC pin maps, topology classifiers, and electrical parameters
- **`ic_data/__init__.py`**: `load_ic_data()`, `register_ic()`, and lookup helpers for the new data store
- **`subcircuits/topology_builders.py`** (new module): dynamic builders — `build_switching_regulator()`, `build_linear_regulator()`, `build_generic()` — that read JSON IC data and produce schematic fragments without hardcoded template classes
- **7 new subcircuit templates** (brings total to 37):
  - `rtc.py` — real-time clocks (DS3231, PCF8563, MCP79410)
  - `eeprom.py` — I2C/SPI EEPROMs (24LCxx, 25LCxx, M95xxx families)
  - `wireless_module.py` — BLE/WiFi/LoRa modules (nRF52-DK, ESP32, RYLR896)
  - `usb_c_connector.py` — USB-C receptacles with CC/SBU routing
  - `spi_bus.py` — SPI bus conditioning (pull-ups, chip-select matrix)
  - `voltage_reference.py` — precision voltage references (REF5025, LM4040, ADR4540)
  - `connector.py` — generic pin-header/through-hole connectors
- **`scripts/extract_ic_data.py`**: harvests IC data entries from datasheet research output
- **`docs/ic-data-system.md`**: reference documentation for the new IC data system

### Changed
- **`subcircuits/base.py`** (+90 lines): `DataDrivenTemplate` class and `SubcircuitRegistry._get_data_driven()` fallback — when the registry has no hardcoded template for a type, it constructs one from JSON IC data and routes through `topology_builders`
- **`list-templates` CLI**: shows data-driven entries alongside legacy templates
- **`scaffold` CLI**: supports data-driven template parameters
- **Minor refactors** to `audio_amplifier.py`, `motor_driver.py`, `protection.py` (misc. tidy-ups; these templates remain hardcoded for now — migration to the data-driven path is a follow-up sprint)
- **Docs refreshed**: `docs/templates.md`, `docs/cli-reference.md`, `scripts/gen_template_docs.py`

### Fixed
- **`.pre-commit-config.yaml`**: updated `circuit_weaver.mvp` references to `circuit_weaver` (post-dispatcher rename)
- **`tests/test_cli_commands.py`**: uses `python -m circuit_weaver` module form

### Tests
- **380 new lines** in `tests/test_template_structure.py`: structural tests for the 7 new templates + IC data store loading/lookup/registration

---

## [0.23.0] - 2026-04-10

### Sprint 31 — Bug Fixes & Error Handling Hardening

### Fixed
- **`_score_from_issues()`** in `confidence_dashboard.py`: returned 100.0 when `total_checks=0` even with errors > 0
- **Logging bridge thread safety**: added `threading.Lock` for `_current_logger` and `_file_handler`; `cleanup_logging()` now uses try/finally
- **Connector MPN validation**: connectors ("J" prefix) no longer exempt from MPN checks in cross-reference validator
- **SPICE value parser**: handles `100pH` (picohenry), values with spaces, standalone F/H units
- **CLI error handling**: confidence, simulate, discover, log-event handlers wrapped in try/except with user-friendly messages

### Sprint 32 — CLI Integration Tests & Output Standardization

### Added
- **24 CLI integration tests** in `tests/test_cli_new_commands.py`: end-to-end tests for discover, simulate, confidence, log-event, log-status, log-view
- Informational messages moved to stderr (HTML report path, simulation output path, log-event confirmation)

### Sprint 33 — Platform Compatibility & Skill UX

### Added
- **OpenCode/Kilo sim shim**: `.agents/skills/sim/SKILL.md` with trigger phrases and CLI commands
- **Updated circuit-weaver shim** with full CLI command reference (discover, validate --enhanced, simulate, confidence, log-event)
- **Platform Guidance** section added to all 9 remaining skills (bom, digikey, mouser, lcsc, jlcpcb, pcbway, ee, vivado, kicad)
- **Skill trigger disambiguation**: bom, design_wizard, kicad, sim skills now have explicit "use X instead for Y" guidance

## [0.22.0] - 2026-04-10

### Sprint 26 — Logging Overhaul

### Added
- **9 new DesignLogger event types** in `design_logger.py`: `part_lookup`, `symbol_resolution`, `simulation`, `thermal`, `erc_drc`, `scoring`, `sourcing`, `generation`, `error` — each with structured JSON fields
- **`logging_bridge.py`** (new module): `DesignLogHandler` bridges Python's `logging` module to `DesignLogger`; `init_logging()` creates both `design.log` (JSON Lines) and `circuit-weaver.log` (text) from workflow start
- **`log-event` CLI subcommand**: skills can call `circuit-weaver log-event <dir> --type <type> --message <msg>` for structured logging
- **Instrumented 7 modules**: `erc_runner`, `dfm_checker`, `validator`, `design_scorer`, `thermal_analysis`, `exporters`, `spice_fetcher` now log to `design.log` via bridge

### Tests
- `tests/test_design_logger_extended.py`: 33 tests — all new event types, bridge routing, singleton accessors, CLI subcommand, extended summary

### Sprint 27 — Project Discovery & Skill Auto-Detection

### Added
- **`project_discovery.py`** (new module): `discover_projects()` scans CWD for `design.yaml`, `.kicad_pro`, and `.kicad_sch` projects with status/type inference and depth control
- **`discover` CLI subcommand**: `circuit-weaver discover [--root .] [--depth 2] [--json]` for project auto-detection
- **Skill auto-detection**: `circuit-weaver`, `design_wizard`, `kicad_validate`, and `sim` skills now run `discover --json` before asking for paths

### Changed
- **`_find_existing_circuits()`** in `dispatcher.py` refactored to use `discover_projects()` from the new module

### Tests
- `tests/test_project_discovery.py`: 20 tests — discovery by type, depth limiting, status inference, CLI output

### Sprint 28 — Circuit Simulation Engine

### Added
- **`spice_netlist.py`** (new module): generates SPICE `.cir` netlists from `ComponentDef` lists with R/C/L primitives, subcircuit instances, and `.tran`/`.ac`/`.dc`/`.op` analysis cards
- **`spice_runner.py`** (new module): ngspice subprocess runner with graceful degradation (`status="skipped"` when not installed), `.raw` file parser, metric extraction (ripple, phase margin, operating points)
- **`simulation.py`** (new module): orchestrator with `plan_simulations()` (auto-detects power/signal/thermal targets), `run_design_simulations()`, and `score_simulation_confidence()` (0-100 scoring)
- **`resolve_spice_models()`** in `spice_fetcher.py`: reads manifest.json to link downloaded models for simulation
- **`simulate` CLI subcommand**: `circuit-weaver simulate design.yaml [-o ./sims] [--type power|signal|thermal|all]`

### Tests
- `tests/test_spice_netlist.py`: 15 tests — netlist generation, passive conversion, analysis cards
- `tests/test_spice_runner.py`: 10 tests — graceful degradation, raw parsing, metric extraction
- `tests/test_simulation.py`: 11 tests — plan detection, confidence scoring, orchestrator integration

### Sprint 29 — Enhanced Validations & Cross-Reference

### Added
- **3 new validation checks** in `validator.py`: `power-budget`, `thermal-limits`, `signal-integrity` (total now 14 checks)
- **`cross_reference_validator.py`** (new module): 3 audit passes — spec vs schematic, schematic vs BOM, component consistency (duplicate refs, floating power pins)
- **`--enhanced` flag** on `validate` CLI: runs cross-reference audit alongside standard validation
- Updated `kicad_validate` skill with new CLI commands

### Tests
- `tests/test_enhanced_validation.py`: 16 tests — all new checks and cross-reference passes

### Sprint 30 — Confidence Dashboard & Workflow Integration

### Added
- **`confidence_dashboard.py`** (new module): aggregates 7 data sources (electrical, simulation, thermal, SI, DFM, cross-reference, ERC/DRC) into weighted 0-100 confidence score with HTML/terminal/JSON output and readiness classification (`ready_for_fab`/`needs_review`/`not_ready`)
- **`confidence` CLI subcommand**: `circuit-weaver confidence design.yaml [--run-sims] [-o report.html] [--pcb file]`

### Changed
- **Wizard workflow restructured** (both `circuit-weaver` and `design_wizard` skills):
  - Step 6 is now **Confidence & Simulation Check** (runs automatically after generation)
  - Step 7 is now **PCB Layout Preparation** with placement optimizer, interactive viewer, SVG export/import, autorouting, and DFM check
  - Step 8 is now **Design Review** with 13-option action menu organized by category
  - All project-skills (`kicad_pcb_place`, `autoroute`, `kicad_gen`, `kicad_hierarchy`, `kicad_pinmap`) are now cross-referenced from main skills
- **Existing Design menu** expanded from 8 to 13 categorized options (Verify / Generate & Layout / Export / Other)

### Tests
- `tests/test_confidence_dashboard.py`: 23 tests — scoring, weight redistribution, readiness, HTML/terminal output, CLI

## [0.21.0] - 2026-04-08

### Sprint 25 — Explainability & Test Points

### Added
- **`_generate_rationale_section(design_ir, log_entries)`** in `review_report.py`: new "Component Selection Rationale" section in the HTML review report. Per-IC table shows why each component was selected (description, key specs from params, wizard/research log entries). Falls back to "Selected via component registry — verify against datasheet" when no rationale is recorded.
- **`_extract_component_rationale(block, log_entries)`** helper: extracts rationale from `DesignBlock.description`, `params` (vin/vout/current/frequency etc.), and optional `design.log` entries.
- **`generate_review_report_html(..., log_entries=...)`**: new optional `log_entries` param threads design.log data into the rationale section.
- **`src/circuit_weaver/test_point_gen.py`** (new module): automatic test point generation from DesignIR.
  - `generate_test_points(design_ir)` — classifies nets as `power_rail`, `ground`, `clock`, `data_bus`, or `differential`; names them TP1, TP2, …
  - `write_test_points_csv(test_points, path)` — emits `{project_name}_test_points.csv` with columns `TestPoint, Net, Type, Priority`
  - `annotate_schematic(content, test_points)` — inserts `(text …)` labels into `.kicad_sch` content
  - `generate_test_point_artifacts(design_ir, output_dir, project_name, schematic_path)` — orchestrates CSV + schematic annotation
- **`generate_artifacts()`** in `dispatcher.py` auto-calls `generate_test_point_artifacts` after schematic generation; result stored under `result["test_points"]`.

### Tests
- `tests/test_review_report.py`: 4 tests — rationale renders per IC, missing rationale shows fallback, HTML escaping correct, key specs from params appear.
- `tests/test_test_point_gen.py`: 6 tests — power rails detected, differential pairs from net names, differential pairs from pcb_constraints, CSV format correct, schematic annotation added, empty design handled.

## [0.18.0] - 2026-04-08

### Sprint 22 — Pinout Verification Gate

### Added
- **`pinout_source` field on `ComponentDef`** (`"explicit"` | `"kicad_library"` | `"stub"`): tracks provenance of every IC's pin assignment. Defaults to `"explicit"` for registry/library components.
- **`pinout_verified` flag on `ComponentDef`**: opt-in override (`pinout_verified: true` in YAML) for users who have manually confirmed a stub pinout against the datasheet.

### Changed
- `digikey_loader.py` and `mouser_loader.py`: replaced silent `"STUB: verify pinmap"` annotation strings with structured `pinout_source="stub"`. Stub ICs no longer silently pollute the annotations list.

### Fixed
- **Task 116 — Pinout Source Validation**: added `_validate_pinout_sources()` check to `validator.py`. Any IC with `pinout_source="stub"` and `pinout_verified=False` now emits `ValidationIssue(level="error", code="unverified-pinout")`, preventing malformed stub schematics from reaching users.
- **Task 117 — Remove STUB annotations**: eliminated all four STUB annotation strings from DigiKey/Mouser loaders; pin provenance is now a typed field rather than an opaque string.
- **Sprint 22 follow-up hardening**:
  - `pinout_verified: true` now flows through standalone YAML/project-spec resolution instead of only direct `ComponentDef` construction
  - explicit YAML `pin_map` now upgrades distributor stubs to `pinout_source="explicit"` and rebuilds concrete pins/nets for generation
  - pinout-source validation now skips only truly pinout-irrelevant passives; diode-style stubs no longer bypass the gate

### Tests
- Added `tests/test_validator.py` with 10 unit tests: stub IC fails, explicit IC passes, spec-level `pinout_verified` and `pin_map` overrides work, passive skipped, diode stub fails, mixed design, multiple stubs, check registration in `_VALIDATION_CHECKS`.

### Sprint 24 — Firmware Co-Design Export

### Added
- **`src/circuit_weaver/firmware_export.py`** (new): `export_pinout_csv()`, `export_stm32_ioc()`, `export_esp32_sdkconfig()`. MCU detection via MPN prefix (STM32*, ESP32*, RP2040, ATmega*, etc.). `infer_peripheral()` maps net names to peripheral types; `infer_direction()` maps PinDef electrical type to IN/OUT/IO/PWR.
- **`generate_artifacts()` auto-emits firmware stubs**: when MCU components are present, `{project}_pinout.csv`, `{project}.ioc` (STM32), and `sdkconfig.defaults` (ESP32) are written to the output directory. Result dict gains `"pinout_csv"`, `"stm32_ioc"`, `"esp32_sdkconfig"` keys.
- **`generate --pinout` flag**: forces pinout CSV emission for non-MCU designs.

### Tests
- Added `tests/test_firmware_export.py` with 22 unit tests covering Tasks 120–122.

### Sprint 23 — Post-Generation ERC

### Added
- **`src/circuit_weaver/erc_runner.py`** (new): `run_erc(schematic)` invokes `kicad-cli sch erc --format json`, parses violation array into `ErcResult` / `ErcViolation` dataclasses. `_classify_severity()` promotes 13 known error types regardless of kicad-cli's own severity field. Degrades gracefully: returns `status="skipped"` when KiCad CLI absent, `status="failed"` on timeout or parse error.
- **`erc` subcommand**: `circuit-weaver erc <schematic> [--json]` — runs ERC and prints human-readable or JSON output; exits 1 if any errors found.
- **`_generate_erc_section()`** in `review_report.py`: green badge when clean, red badge + violation table when errors, neutral notice when skipped or not run. Accepts both `ErcResult` objects and plain dicts.

### Changed
- `generate_artifacts()` now auto-runs ERC after schematic generation when the root schematic is available; adds `"erc"` key to the result dict.
- `generate_review_report_html()` gains optional `erc_result` parameter; ERC section rendered above DFM section.

### Tests
- Added `tests/test_erc_runner.py` with 12 unit tests: mock kicad-cli success, timeout, absent CLI, JSON parsing, severity classification/promotion, `to_dict` roundtrip, missing schematic.
- Added `tests/test_review_report_erc.py` with 6 unit tests: clean badge, error badge + table, skipped, failed, None input, dict input.

## [0.17.0] - 2026-04-07

### Sprint 20 — Design Review Completion & Sourcing Audit

### Added (Task 107 — Component Sourcing Risk Audit)
- **Component sourcing auditor** (`sourcing_auditor.py`):
  - `audit_bom()` — queries LCSC (stock/lead time) and DigiKey (lifecycle) for each component
  - Risk classification: CRITICAL (obsolete, out-of-stock, >16 week lead), WARNING (low stock <100, lead 8-16 weeks), OK
  - Identifies specific issues per component (out-of-stock, low stock, long lead time, obsolete, no distributor PN)
  - `AuditFinding` and `AuditReport` dataclasses for structured output
  - `audit_report_text()` for human-readable reports with CRITICAL/WARNING/OK sections and recommendations
  - Integrates with existing `PartsLookup` and `compile_design_ir()` for BOM analysis
  - 20 unit tests covering risk classification, issue identification, and report generation

### Changed (Task 109 — Dispatcher Refactor)
- **Renamed core module** `mvp.py` → `dispatcher.py`:
  - Reflects actual role: CLI subcommand dispatcher, not MVP
  - Updated all imports in source code (7 modules), tests (6 test suites), and documentation
  - Updated module docstring to clarify dispatcher + workflow engine role
  - Updated CONTRIBUTING.md, api-reference.md, architecture.md, cli-reference.md
  - All tests pass with new module name

### Fixed
- **Task 112 — Single-sheet schematic naming**:
  - Fixed single-sheet generation to write `{project_name}.kicad_sch` instead of generic `main.kicad_sch`
  - Preserved existing multi-sheet root naming behavior
  - Added bootstrap and CLI regression coverage for example-project artifact names
- **Task 113 — No .py artifacts in output**:
  - Confirmed current code never writes `.py` files to output directory
  - `--output` is required; all writes target the specified directory only
- **Task 114 — Circuit-weaver log file**:
  - `generate_artifacts()` now writes `circuit-weaver.log` to the output directory
  - Captures: validation warnings, component count, sheet allocations, file paths written
  - Key `print()` calls in `generator.py` converted to `_logger.info()` for file capture
- **Task 115 — S-expression paren-balance guard**:
  - Added `_validate_sexpr_balance()` called before each `.kicad_sch` write
  - Emits `_logger.warning()` (captured in log file) if open/close parens don't balance
  - Prevents silent malformed schematic output from reaching users

### Tests
- All 60+ existing tests pass with dispatcher.py module name
- Added 20 new tests for sourcing auditor (test_sourcing_auditor.py)
- Added 3 new Sprint 21 regression tests: no-.py-artifacts, log-file, paren-balance

  - Parses `.kicad_pcb` S-expression format to extract traces, vias, board dimensions
  - Returns structured `DFMViolation` objects with severity (critical/warning), actual vs minimum values, fix suggestions
  - `check_dfm()` function and `dfm_report()` for human-readable output
  - CLI command: `circuit-weaver check-dfm <design.kicad_pcb> [--profile jlcpcb|pcbway]`

### Added (Task 108 — Design Documentation Generator)
- **Design documentation generator** (`design_docs.py`):
  - `generate_assembly_guide_csv()` — exports BOM table: reference, value, footprint, MPN, manufacturer
  - `generate_power_budget_csv()` — estimates power per supply rail based on component categories
  - `generate_ordering_checklist()` — markdown checklist with per-distributor status
  - `generate_datasheet_index()` — markdown index of all downloaded datasheets
  - `generate_all_docs()` — orchestrator to generate all documentation types at once
  - CLI command: `circuit-weaver generate-docs <design.yaml> --output docs/ [--datasheets-dir X]`
  - Supports integration with BOM workflow: `cost-bom → generate-docs`

### Added (Task 106 — Interactive Design Review Report)
- **HTML design review report generator** (`review_report.py`):
  - `generate_review_report_html()` — generates comprehensive, self-contained HTML reports
  - **Report sections**:
    - Design summary card with project name, version, overall score/grade, creation timestamp
    - Pre-fabrication checklist (8 standard review items, user-checkable)
    - Detailed scoring breakdown with visual bar charts for all 5 quality dimensions

    - Fully self-contained (all data + styles in single HTML file)
  - CLI command: `circuit-weaver review-report <design.yaml> [--kicad-pcb board.kicad_pcb] --output report.html`
  - Optional DFM integration: analyzes violations from .kicad_pcb file if provided

### Added (Task 105 — Enhanced Design Scoring)
- **Comprehensive design quality scoring** (`design_scorer.py`):
  - `DetailedElectricalQualityScore` dataclass with per-section breakdown
  - **5 quality dimensions** (each scored 0-100, A-F grading):
    - **Power Integrity:** bulk capacitor presence, decoupling coverage, voltage regulator identification
    - **Signal Integrity:** pull-up/pull-down resistor detection, differential pair indicators
    - **Placement Quality:** component reference designation coverage, thermal constraints
    - **Thermal:** power component identification, operating temperature range specification
    - **Manufacturing:** MPN coverage, part sourcing bindings, assembly complexity (package variety)
  - Weighted composite score (20% each dimension) with letter grades A-F
  - `score_design_comprehensive()` analyzes `DesignIR` and returns detailed breakdown
  - `summary_with_gaps()` method flags sections < 75 score with actionable recommendations
  - CLI integration: `circuit-weaver validate --detailed-score` adds scoring to validation output

  - 17 design documentation tests: BOM table extraction, power budget calculation, CSV/markdown exports
  - 19 design scoring tests: score creation, all 5 dimensions, weighted composites, gap detection, grade mapping
  - All tests passing in ~0.25s total

### Changed
- `mvp.py`: Added three new CLI subcommands: `check-dfm`, `generate-docs`, `review-report` with full argument parsing
- `__init__.py`: Exported scoring, design_docs, DFM, and review_report functions in public API
- `validate` command: Added `--detailed-score` flag to include 5-dimension quality analysis

---

## [0.15.2] - 2026-04-07 (Hotfix)

### Fixed
- **Design wizard architecture**: Restructured to use SKILL.md instructions instead of broken Python-level platform detection
  - Python code cannot invoke Claude Code tools (AskUserQuestion) — only Claude instructions can
  - Removed non-functional `interactive_prompts.py` module (dead code)
  - Refactored `_run_design_wizard()` to use plain `input()` for CLI compatibility
  - Restored cross-platform support: Claude Code (buttons), Codex/OpenCode (conversational), CLI (terminal input)
- **Dependencies**: Removed unused `questionary` from optional dependencies

### Architecture
- Interactive prompts now handled by SKILL.md instructions (Claude invokes AskUserQuestion)
- Python `mvp.py` contains only CLI implementation (non-interactive input())
- CLI mode: `python -m circuit_weaver design-wizard` with plain input() prompts

- Task 61 (costed BOM) confirmed already complete from Sprint 12 — checkboxes updated

### Tests
- Design validation CI validates all `samples/` and `examples/` specs on every push

## [0.10.1] - 2026-04-05

### Sprint 12 — Platform Integrity: Guided CLI Workflow

### Added
- `/circuit-weaver` master orchestrator skill — LLM-first skill that routes new vs existing designs, orchestrates research-analyst agent (Perplexity IC research), CLI subcommands, and generates quote-ready outputs
- Skill implementation: `skills/circuit-weaver/SKILL.md` with Steps 0-7 (new design: welcome → requirements → research → BOM → schematic → review → export; existing design: load → validate/regenerate/export/modify)
- `.agents/skills/circuit-weaver/SKILL.md` compatibility stub for Claude Code discovery
- `cost-bom` CLI subcommand — generates costed BOM with LCSC pricing at multiple volume breaks (1, 10, 100, 1000 qty)
- `cost_bom.py` module: queries LCSC, extracts price tiers, calculates per-board and total costs
- Extended `parts_lookup.py` with `get_unit_price()` helper to select correct price tier for given quantity
- Price tier parsing in `_search_lcsc()` — converts API `extra.prices` array to `[{min_qty, max_qty, unit_price}]` dicts
- Rewrote `design_wizard/SKILL.md` Step 3c to reflect real CLI workflow: `scaffold` → `apply-patch` → `cost-bom`
- All wizard steps now reference working CLI commands (removed non-existent analyze_schematic.py, kicad_gen, kicad_pcb_place, kicad_validate)
- Automated installation scripts: `install.ps1` (Windows) and `install.sh` (Mac/Linux) — handles Python package setup, PATH configuration, and Claude Code skill registration in one command

### Changed
- Design wizard Step 3c: shifted from abstract BOM description to concrete `scaffold`+`apply-patch`+`cost-bom` commands
- Design wizard Step 5a: replaced non-existent script call with `circuit-weaver validate` direct call
- Design wizard Step 6c: Freerouting made optional (separate installation required, graceful fallback)
- Installation process: automated via `install.ps1` (Windows) and `install.sh` (Mac/Linux) — one-command setup eliminates manual pip/PATH/skill registration steps

### Fixed
- Removed non-existent `comp.dnp` attribute check in `cost_bom.py` (ComponentDef has no DNP field)

### Tests
- `cost-bom samples/iot_sensor_node/iot_sensor_node.yaml --qty 1,10` verified working
- All wizard steps now use real, tested CLI commands
- Version bump: 0.9.0 → 0.10.1

## [0.9.0] - 2026-04-05

- 5 diff tests covering add/remove/change/metadata/HTML output

### Sprint 10 — Close the Fab Gap

### Added
- `export-jlcpcb` CLI subcommand — exports BOM and CPL CSV files for JLCPCB assembly ordering
- `export-gerbers` CLI subcommand — wraps KiCad CLI to export Gerber and drill files with ZIP output
- Fabrication notes section in design reports (`_fab_notes_section()`) — auto-detects package types and recommends PCB specs (layer count, surface finish, assembly requirements)
- 5 new realistic sample designs: battery-powered IoT sensor, motor controller, OLED display module, USB-UART bridge, FPGA power carrier
- CPL placement data extraction from `generate_pcb_placement()` — returns both PCB file path and placement coordinates dict
- `jlcpcb_export.py` module with BOM grouping by (value, footprint, lcsc_pn) and CSV export
- BOM and CPL tests in `test_bootstrap.py`

### Changed
- `generate_pcb_placement()` signature: now returns `tuple[str, dict[str, tuple[float, float, float, str]]]` instead of just `str`
- Sample validation expanded: 8 total samples (3 original + 5 new), 159 tests passing (was 133)

### Fixed
- Circular import in `jlcpcb_export.py` resolved by deferring `compile_design_ir` import inside function

### Tests
- 159 total tests passing (8 samples × 4 validation tests each + other test suites)
- All 5 new samples pass validation with expected warnings (missing LCSC codes, floating pins on MCU)
- Version bump: 0.8.0 → 0.9.0

## [0.8.0] - 2026-04-05

### Sprint 9 — Unblock Day-1 Onboarding

- Net connectivity check counts bypass_caps and straps as connections (FB/BST nets no longer flagged)
- MCU floating GPIO warnings summarized (28 warnings → 1 summary)
- Bootstrap tests tolerate KiCad CLI unavailability

### Fixed
- Net connectivity validator treated passive components (feedback dividers, pull-ups, bootstrap caps) as undriven — now recognizes passive pin type as valid driver
- 4 test_presentation.py failures caused by false-positive undriven-net warnings on internal subcircuit nets

### Tests
- 133 total tests passing (was 113 + 4 failures)
- Version bump: 0.7.0 → 0.8.0

## [0.7.0] - 2026-04-05

### Sprint 6–8 — Circuit Quality Overhaul

Comprehensive rework of circuit generation quality. The engine now catches floating pins,
validates power domains, checks bus completeness, and scores electrical quality — reducing
the ~50% error rate in generated circuits to near zero for template-based designs.

### Added
- **Pin-type-aware no-connect classification** (`generator.py`): replaces blanket NC with per-pin-type logic — errors on floating power_in, warns on floating inputs, silently NC's outputs and NC-named pins
- **`explicit_no_connects` field** on `ComponentDef`: templates declare intentionally unconnected pins (7 templates migrated: USB, clock, ethernet, opamp, relay_driver, sensor_frontend, charge_pump)
- **`_validate_pin_coverage()`** gate in MVP pipeline: catches floating pins at design-validation time
- **Power domain cross-check** (`_validate_power_domain_consistency`): conflicting voltage requirements, rail name vs voltage mismatch, missing bypass cap declarations
- **PWR_FLAG auto-generation**: one `PWR_FLAG` per unique power net per sheet for KiCad ERC compliance (`sexpr_pwr_flag_lib_entry`, `sexpr_pwr_flag_instance`)
- **Net connectivity graph**: single-pin-net (dangling) and undriven-net (input-only, no driver) detection
- **Enable pin validation**: detects floating EN/SHDN/CE pins on regulators that would prevent startup
- **Bus completeness checks**: I2C missing pull-ups, SPI floating CS, UART unpaired TX/RX
- **Intent annotations**: generator annotates schematics with "Unused: PIN(num): NC" summaries
- **Auto schema-driven `validate_params()`** on `SubcircuitTemplate` base class: type checking, required params, options validation, range bounds
- **Component contract validation** (`SubcircuitResult.validate_contract()`): components present, ICs have power pins, boundary ports declared
- **Inductor selection validator**: flags inductors < 0.1µH or > 100µH on switching converters
- **Capacitor voltage rating validator**: warns when rail voltage exceeds 80% of cap rating
- **In-process ERC** (`_validate_pin_type_conflicts`): output-to-output on same net = bus contention
- **Electrical quality scorer** (`score_electrical_quality`): weighted composite of pin coverage, decoupling, power pin coverage, validation pass rate — 0–100 score with A–F grade
- **`--strict` mode**: `validate_design(strict=True)` treats warnings as errors; CLI flag on validate subcommand
- **Design checklist generator** (`generate_design_checklist`): Markdown with checkbox items for pre-fab review
- **Fix suggestions** on `ValidationIssue`: `suggestion` field with actionable remediation text
- **EasyEDA pin type enrichment**: infers input/output/bidirectional from name patterns when EasyEDA type is "unspecified"
- **Pin count sanity check**: ICs with < 3 pins flagged as likely incomplete symbol
- **Footprint-to-pin consistency**: extracts pad count from footprint name (QFN-48, SOIC-8, BGA-121) and compares to symbol pin count

### Changed
- **Validation now has 10 checks** (was 4): feedback-divider, rc-lc-filter, crystal-load, decoupling, inductor-selection, cap-voltage, net-connectivity, enable-pins, bus-completeness, pin-type-conflicts
- **`_FEEDBACK_VREF`** expanded from 1 IC (AP62300TWU) to 7 (+ TPS62088, TPS61230A, MT3608, TPS63020, TPS63000)
- **`valid` computation** in `validate_design`: only errors cause failure (warnings are informational unless `--strict`)
- Power pin inference in `kicad_lib.py` expanded from 8 name patterns to 20+ (AVDD, DVDD, EPAD, EP, VBAT, VSYS, etc.)
- Power pin inference in `easyeda_parser.py` expanded with VDDCORE, VDD_*, VCC_*, 1P2, 2P5 variants

### Fixed
- **opamp.py**: replaced hardcoded pin numbers ("1","2","3") with database lookups (`pin_out_a`, `pin_inm_a`, `pin_inp_a`)
- **power_mux.py**: replaced hardcoded LTC4357 VIN pins 6/7/8 with `pin_vin_extra` database field
- **can_transceiver.py**: RS pin moved from `power_pins` to `pin_nets` (input type, not power); fixed ordering bug
- **usb.py**: CYUSB3014 wires all data bus pins (SSRX, GPIF, SPI, RESET, XTALIN); USB2514B unused pins → explicit NC
- **ethernet.py**: KSZ9031 RGMII data bus + PHY pair pins wired to named nets
- **clock.py**: AD9528 unused optional inputs → explicit_no_connects
- **relay_driver.py**: ULN2003A unused channel inputs → explicit_no_connects
- **sensor_frontend.py**: INA128PA RG gain pins at unity → explicit_no_connects

### Tests
- 123 total tests passing (was 106), 26 in test_template_structure.py
- 0 regressions across all 4 commits
- Version bump: 0.6.0 → 0.7.0

## [0.6.0] - 2026-04-03

### Sprint 5 — EasyEDA/LCSC Symbol Import Pipeline

### Added
- EasyEDA API client (`easyeda_api.py`): fetch symbol/footprint data from JLCPCB/LCSC by LCSC part number — zero auth, 300K+ parts, 7-day disk cache
- EasyEDA symbol parser (`easyeda_parser.py`): parse tilde-delimited shapes into PinDefs with power/signal classification, footprint inference from 25+ package patterns, category inference from description keywords
- 4th-tier component resolution fallback: built-in → KiCad official lib → JSON DB → **EasyEDA/LCSC**
- YAML `lcsc:` key support — specify `lcsc: C14663` on any component to fetch from EasyEDA
- MPN-to-LCSC auto-discovery: when `parts_lookup.py` finds an LCSC code for an MPN, the EasyEDA tier fires automatically
- `lcsc_pn` and `digikey_pn` first-class fields on `ComponentDef` (replaces features-list workaround)
- `search_easyeda()` function for keyword search across JLCPCB component library
- EasyEDA regression coverage in `test_easyeda_import.py` for pin parsing, symbol assembly, ComponentDef conversion, footprint/category inference, and mocked resolution paths

### Changed
- `enrich_component()` now populates `lcsc_pn` and `digikey_pn` fields directly (backward-compatible: still writes features list too)
- Resolution chain stub message updated to mention EasyEDA as a checked source
- Version bump: 0.5.0 → 0.6.0

### Fixed
- EasyEDA imports now fail closed when any UUID payload is missing, instead of silently returning a truncated symbol
- Explicit YAML `lcsc:` keys now prefer EasyEDA import even when earlier registry/KiCad tiers would otherwise resolve the part by name
- `easyeda_to_component_def()` now carries `lcsc_pn` directly from EasyEDA metadata
- Restored `LTC4357CMS8` support in the `power_mux` template after the sprint 5 regression review

### Tests
- Added regression coverage for incomplete EasyEDA UUID fetches, explicit `lcsc:` override precedence, and restored `LTC4357CMS8` generation

## [0.5.0] - 2026-04-03

## [0.4.0] - 2026-04-03

### Sprint 3 — Placement, Routing & Presentation Readiness

### Added
- Schematic aesthetics scorer (`scorer.py`): 6-metric rule-based quality gate (spacing uniformity, whitespace ratio, label overlap, wire crossings, aspect ratio, density)
- `score_layout()` returns 0-100 score with A-F grade; `score_project()` aggregates across sheets
- `--score` CLI flag on `generate` subcommand; piped through `generate_artifacts()` API
- LDO cluster motif renderer (`_apply_topology_ldo_cluster`): CIN + COUT as compact unit below IC

- Dispatch chain: buck -> LDO cluster -> CC network -> decoupling bank -> strap ladder -> sidecar
- 10 new tests in `test_sprint3.py`

### Changed
- Sidecar cluster distinguishes single-passive (inline) from multi-passive (grid) placement

### Tests

### Changed
- `symbol_to_component_def()` now accepts `lib_name` parameter for library-aware classification
- `get_component()` passes resolved library name through search cache
- Category inference priority: library name > ref prefix > description keywords
- `project_spec.py` skips metadata keys (`spec_version`, `presentation_profile`, `components_db`) in section loop

### Tests
- 58 total tests passing (no regressions)

## [0.2.0] - 2026-04-02

### Sprint 1 — Robust KiCad Import Pipeline

### Added
- Stub ComponentDefs for unresolved components — never silently drop parts
- `_make_stub_component()` creates visible "UNRESOLVED" placeholders in schematics
- `_apply_power_map()` remaps KiCad power pin names to project rail names (VCC→VDD_3P3, etc.)
- `_apply_net_prefix()` prevents net collisions by prefixing generic signal names with ref (Q1_G, Q1_S)
- Optional `power_map` dict in YAML spec for explicit power pin remapping
- "Miscellaneous / Discrete" sheet category for unknown/protection/discrete/analog components
- Passive inference from bare YAML entries: `{value: "10k", ref: "R1"}` resolves without `ic:` field
- Expanded section category map: analog, discrete, motor, protection, audio, display, misc
- 26 new tests in `test_import_pipeline.py`

### Changed
