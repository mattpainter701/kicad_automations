"""Sprint 41 — placement-readiness gate.

Promotes the subset of existing validator issues that block PCB placement
from warnings in the ``electrical`` category into hard errors in a new
``placement_readiness`` category. ``dispatcher.generate_artifacts`` treats
this category as non-bypassable (like ``structural`` / ``implementation``),
so any design that emits a ``.kicad_sch`` file is guaranteed to be wired
end-to-end with no dangling buses, no floating enables, and no
unverified-stub ICs.

The pure function :func:`placement_readiness_issues` re-reads the already
computed :class:`~circuit_weaver.validator.ValidationCheckResult` list plus
the compiled design IR so no check is re-run twice. It does not mutate
anything.
